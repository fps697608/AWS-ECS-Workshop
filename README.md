# AWS ECS Workshop Series

In this series, we will create a Docker image which provides web service, push the image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry ([Amazon ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/)) which is a fully-managed Docker container registry and run a container serving as a web server with the image stored in ECR.

## Prerequisites
* An AWS account.
* Make sure the region is **US East (N. Virginia)**, which its short name is **us-east-1**.
